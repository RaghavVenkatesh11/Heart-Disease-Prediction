# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The Heart Disease Prediction project leverages a dataset containing 303 entries and 14 features to predict the presence or absence of heart disease. The features include demographic and health-related attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol levels (chol), and others. The dataset is clean, with no missing values, making it suitable for analysis. Initial exploration revealed that 165 individuals have heart disease, while 138 do not. Visualizations such as bar plots were used to analyze the distribution of the target variable and other features. Statistical summaries provided insights into the dataset's numerical and categorical attributes. The project aims to preprocess the data and build machine learning models for accurate predictions, which can assist in early detection and preventive measures for heart disease. Future steps include implementing models and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy and precision.
